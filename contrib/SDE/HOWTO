Performance API (PAPI) features a Software Defined Events
Interface (PAPI-SDE) that allows runtimes and libraries,
like PaRSEC to expose internal counters to applications
through PAPI.

PaRSEC exposes a set of internal counters using this feature.

To enable it, it is sufficient to link the application with
PAPI (SDE enabled) and PaRSEC. Events exposed by PaRSEC then
become available through the tools that understand PAPI
(e.g. Tau, Score-P, etc.).

As PaRSEC understands PAPI as a client, it is also possible
to access these counters using the PaRSEC INStrumentation
interface (PINS), see the PaRSEC wiki to enable and access
the events internally.


The other files in this directory provide a very simple
library that a user can LD_PRELOAD to display the current
value of a PAPI counter every 100ms. They can be used
to test the behavior of the PAPI-SDE counters in PaRSEC.
